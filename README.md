## Configuration

This project uses the [@area73/ai-web-key-configurator](https://github.com/area73/ai-web-key-configurator) web component for managing environment variables and API keys.

### About the Web Component

- **Purpose**: Provides a simple, reusable interface for configuring environment variables in the browser.
- **How it works**: Renders a `<key-configurator>` element with multiple `<key-pair>` children, each containing a `<key-name>` and an editable `<key-value>`. The `id` attribute is used as the localStorage namespace.
- **Example Usage:**
  ```html
  <key-configurator id="ai-social-creator-config">
    <key-pair>
      <key-name>OPENAI_API_KEY</key-name>
      <key-value></key-value>
    </key-pair>
    <key-pair>
      <key-name>LINKEDIN_TOKEN</key-name>
      <key-value></key-value>
    </key-pair>
    <key-pair>
      <key-name>LINKEDIN_CLIENT_ID</key-name>
      <key-value></key-value>
    </key-pair>
    <key-pair>
      <key-name>LINKEDIN_CLIENT_SECRET</key-name>
      <key-value></key-value>
    </key-pair>
  </key-configurator>
  ```
- **Local Storage**: All values are saved in the browser's localStorage under the given `id`.
- **Documentation**: See [@area73/ai-web-key-configurator](https://github.com/area73/ai-web-key-configurator)

---

## LinkedIn Integration

- **OAuth Connection**: Securely connect your LinkedIn account using OAuth.
- **Post Publishing**: Write and publish posts directly to your LinkedIn feed.
- **Scopes Required**: Your LinkedIn app must have the following scopes enabled:
  - `w_member_social` (for posting)
